# Credit Salon Submissions and Reviews

This page contains the articles and software projects prospective attendees of the first Credit Salon have submitted for peer review. I've linked each of them below along with some of my own perspective. Please comment on two or more other submissions in the comment section below as proof of work in order to receive the meetup location and secret password for free food and beverages.
