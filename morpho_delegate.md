# Delegate Platform

This post is my delegate platform for the [Morpho](https://www.morpho.xyz/) DAO. You can delegate voting power to me at onetruekirk.eth on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/morpho.eth).

## Why I am interested in Morpho governance

Volt Protocol is a depositor in Morpho-Compound ([currently about 5% of supply](https://zapper.fi/account/0x7ab2f4a29048392efe0b57fd17a3bedbcd0891dc?) in the DAI market), meaning I will be keeping a close eye on risk in this market including monitoring all governance changes in both Compound and Morpho protocols. I think it worthwhile to share publicly my observations and, at times, to [advocate for greater caution](https://www.comp.xyz/t/investigate-market-manipulation-risk-in-zrx-and-other-tokens/3555) and [risk mitigation](https://governance.aave.com/t/a-game-theoretical-analysis-of-potential-avax-usd-price-manipulation-attack-on-aave/10196/4?u=onetruekirk) in on chain lending markets where Volt Protocol deposits or considers depositing. In the long run, I am hoping that a stronger culture of peer review will help DeFi move towards minimum risk and maximum reliability.

## How I will vote

The Volt Protocol team has identified certain long tail collaterals that pose outsize risk in the Aave v2 market, such as BAT, BAL, and ZRX. Compound has taken more substantive action to mitigate these risks by [pausing supply of potentially vulnerable assets](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/131). As Volt Protocol exclusively deposits in Morpho-Compound, rather than Morpho-Aave, I will also vote to direct MORPHO incentives toward the Compound DAI and USDC supply markets where Volt Protocol lends. This is the primary selfish benefit I will get from your delegation, so if you're farming Morpho-Aave with ETH collateral, I might not be your preferred delegate choice.

In any vote, my priority will be representing the interests of lenders in minimizing risks. I will vote against the addition of high risk collateral assets even when present in the underlying market (ie, push against the addition of long tail collaterals present in Aave to Morpho-Aave).

I will support changes to further the growth of Morpho and its lending efficiency, such as the addition of new borrowable assets, and look forward to integrating future Morpho markets with Volt Protocol.
