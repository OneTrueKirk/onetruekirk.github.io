Notes on Rari Compensation Plans

Spent a few hours today in Rari Capital's Discord.

The team is moving fast in regard to the hack, main options for compensation are:
1) give RGT to affected victims, likely with vesting
2) take a loan to reimburse victims
3) issue an IOU or protocol bond to victims

Some in the Discord are reluctant to receive RGT as compensation due to liquidity concerns or capital gains taxes.

I favor the first approach, especially with the combination of liquidity incentives for RGT on Uniswap V3.

My vote will be in favor of making those who lost funds whole ASAP, with minimal change needed to the protocol/minimal introduction of additional complexity.
