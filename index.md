Liquid governance has been on my mind. For projects like Rari or XToken, how can RGT or XTK holders express more continuous/nuanced opinions about risk within their system? Something like the CRV guage system or other continuous market parameter system would be ideal. XTK backing and collecting revenue from xSNXa would be on the line for any loss of funds in xSNXa through slashing or other mechanism. In Rari, this could be done to let RGT "vote" in a continuous and organic way to allocate the yield aggregator among the Fuse pools.

100% reimbursement leads the vote at Rari, based on Discord discussion seems like the team is leaning toward liquidity mining on Uniswap V3 to establish sufficient liquidity to support airdrop. There is enough liquidity in pool2 that can be shifted to support a certain price band in v3.

Notes on Rari Compensation Plans

Spent a few hours today in Rari Capital's Discord.

The team is moving fast in regard to the hack, main options for compensation are:
1) give RGT to affected victims, likely with vesting
2) take a loan to reimburse victims
3) issue an IOU or protocol bond to victims

Some in the Discord are reluctant to receive RGT as compensation due to liquidity concerns or capital gains taxes.

I favor the first approach, especially with the combination of liquidity incentives for RGT on Uniswap V3.

My vote will be in favor of making those who lost funds whole ASAP, with minimal change needed to the protocol/minimal introduction of additional complexity.
